# transactify

## Introduction

Welcome to **Transactify**!
This is a small open source project, which was created in a competition. This one is about programming a net worth app.
The app was created with a time investment of more than 35 hours by Tomic Riedel and was created within 3 weeks.

## Getting Started
If you downloaded the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Tomic-Riedel/transactify), we can get started right away.

    1. Open the terminal.
    
    2. Navigate to the path where you want to save this project with "cd {your path}".
    
    3. Now create a new project with "**flutter create transactify**".
    
    4. After that navigate to the created folder with your file management app and delete the files/folders "**lib**", "**pubspec.yaml**" and "**README.md**".
    
    5. Then go to the folder where you downloaded this project (transactify) with your file management app and copy the files/folders "**assets**", "**lib**",          "**pubspec.yaml**" and "**README.md**".
    
    6. Then paste the copied files into the project you created earlier.
    
    7. Now you can open the project with your IDE. Since there are many different IDEs, you should know how to do this yourself.
    
    8. Now you will see a lot of errors in the "lib" folder. To fix them, navigate to pubspec.yaml and run "flutter pub get" from your IDE. In Visual Studio Code        you will see a small icon in the upper right corner which looks like a download icon. Click on it once.
       If you are in IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio, you will see a "Pub get" button in the top right corner. Click on it and et voil√†, no more errors will be          displayed.
       If you don't have an IDE or your IDE doesn't have "flutter pub get" integrated, you can go back to the terminal, navigate to your project path with "cd          {path}" and run "flutter pub get" there.
    
    9. now open the simulator/emulator of your choice on which you run the app. Please use only an Android or iOS simulator, as the app will not work on macOS,          Windows, Linux or Web.
    10. The last step is to run the app. You can do this easily in the terminal by navigating to your project again with "cd {path}" and then running "flutter           run".
        You can also run this command in your IDE by going into the "main.dart" and seeing a small play icon in the upper right corner. If you are using VS Code,         you will then be presented with another small choice of whether you want to debug the app or just run it. There you click on "Start without debugging".
        
    11. Ready! Your app is now set up!


## Other important things!
    1. if you find bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please create an issue at [GitHub](https://github.com), because I have not only programmed the app          for the competition, but would also like to develop it further.
    
    2. You are NOT allowed to publish this app. You are prohibited from publishing this app or any modified form of it in any app store or otherwise.
    
    3. If you want to link this app on any website, you must always give the associated GitHub repository and make the creator (Tomic Riedel) directly visible.          Also, you must not claim it as your own!
